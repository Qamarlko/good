Bukowski, an alcoholic who became a writer at an old age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I have one of two choices – stay in the post office and go crazy… or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bukowski wrote his first novel in three weeks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It is strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don’t try”… See, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew it. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but from the fact that he <i>knew </i>he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in Bukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself – especially the worst parts of himself – and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Fame and success didn’t make him a better person. Nor was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fame and success won’t make you a better person. And becoming a better person doesn’t mean that you’re going to be famous or successful.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… when you stop and really think about it, conventional life advice – all the positive and happy self-help stuff we hear all the time – is actually fixating on what you <i>lack</i>. It lasers in on <i>what you perceive your personal shortcomings and failures to already be</i>, and then emphasizes them for you. You learn about the best ways to make money <i>because </i>you feel you don’t have enough money already. You stand in front of the mirror and repeat affirmations saying that you’re beautiful <i>because </i>you feel as though you’re not beautiful already. You follow dating and relationship advice <i>because </i>you feel that you’re unlovable already. You try goofy visualization exercises about being more successful <i>because </i>you feel as though you aren’t successful enough already… Ironically, this fixation on the positive – on what’s better, what’s superior – only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just <i>is</i>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“There’s a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the loudest.” A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich. Either you are or you are not. And if you’re dreaming of something all the time, then you’re reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over; that you are <i>not that</i>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more –buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, <i>be </i>more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick… Why? My guess: because giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business… And while there’s nothing wrong with good business, the problem is that giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health. It causes you to become overly attached to the superficial and fake, to dedicate your life to chasing a mirage of happiness and satisfaction. They key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Feedback Loop from Hell</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming <i>anxious about being anxious</i>. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing <i>more </i>anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Or let’s say you have an anger problem. You get pissed off at the stupidest, most inane stuff, and you have no idea why. And the fact that you get pissed off so easily starts to piss you off even more. And then, in your petty rage, you realize that being angry all the time makes you a shallow and mean person, and you hate this; you hate it so much that you get angry at yourself. Now look at you: you’re angry at yourself getting angry about being angry. Fuck you, wall. Here, have a fist.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Or you’re so worried about doing the right thing all the time that you become worried about how much you’re worrying. Or you feel so guilty for every mistake you make that you begin to feel guilty about how guilty you’re feeling. Or you get sad and alone so often that it makes you feel even more said and alone just thinking about it.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Welcome to the Feedback Loop from Hell. Chances are you’ve engaged in it more than a few times. Maybe you’re engaging in it right now: “God, I do the Feedback Loop all the time – I’m such a loser for doing it. I should stop. Oh my God, I feel like such a loser for calling myself a loser. I should stop calling myself a loser. Ah, fuck! I’m doing it again! See? I’m a loser! Argh!”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Very few animals on earth have the ability to think cogent thoughts to begin with, but we humans have the luxury of being able to have thoughts <i>about </i>our thoughts… So I can think about watching Miley Cyrus videos on YouTube, and then immediately think about what a sicko I am for wanting to watch Miley Cyrus videos on YouTube… Now here’s the problem: Our society today, through the wonders of consumer culture and hey-look-at-my-life-is-cooler-than-yours social media, has bred a whole generation of people who believe that having these negative experiences – anxiety, fear, guilt, etc. –is totally not okay. I mean, if you look at your Facebook feed, everybody there is having a fucking grand old time… Meanwhile, you’re stuck at home flossing your cat. And you can’t help but think your life sucks even more than you thought.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The Feedback Loop from Hell has become a borderline epidemic, making many of us overly stressed, overly neurotic, and overly self-loathing… Back in Grandpa’s day, he would feel like shit and think to himself, “Gee whiz, I sure do feel like a cow turd today. But hey, I guess that’s just life. Back to shoveling hay.” … But now? Now if you feel like shit for even five minutes, you’re bombarded with 350 images of people <i>totally happy and having amazing fucking lives</i>, and it’s impossible to not feel like there’s something wrong with you.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“It’s this last part that gets us into trouble. We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty for feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry.

And paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.</b>”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<i>Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience</i>. It’s what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “the backwards law” – the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place. The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. The more you want to be spiritually enlightened, the more self-centered and shallow you become in trying to get there.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“As the existential philosopher Albert Camus said…: “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of.

Notice how it’s often the person who is least invested in the success of something that actually ends up achieving it?

What’s with that?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What’s interesting about the backwards law is that it’s called “backwards” for a reason: not giving a fuck works in reverse. If pursuing the positive <i>is </i>a negative, then pursuing the negative generates the positive. The pain you pursue in the gym results in</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">better all-around health and energy. The failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what’s necessary to be successful. Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<i>Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience</i>.

They imagine and aspire to be a person who is shaken by nothing and caves in to no one… There’s a name for a person who finds no emotion or meaning in anything: a psychopath. Why you would want to emulate a psychopath, I have no fucking clue… So what <i>does </i>not giving a fuck mean? Let’s look at three “subtleties” that should help clarify the matter.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their hair, so they never bother washing or combing it. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their ideas, so they hide behind sarcasm and self-righteous snark. They’re afraid to let anyone get close to them, so they imagine themselves as some special, unique snowflake who has problems that nobody else would ever understand.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Indifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices. That’s why they don’t make any meaningful choices. They hide in a gray, emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitying, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… here’s the sneaky truth about life. There’s no such thing as not giving a fuck. <i>You must give a fuck about something</i>. It’s part of our biology to always care about something and therefor to always give a fuck… The question, then, is, <i>What </i>do we give a fuck about? What are we <i>choosing </i>to give a fuck about? And how can we not give a fuck about what ultimately does not matter?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This illustrated the first subtlety of not giving a fuck. When we say, “Damn, watch out, Mark Manson just don’t give a fuck,” we don’t mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about <i>anything</i>; on the contrary, we mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn’t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble. We mean that Mark Manson is the type of guy who would write about himself in third person just because he thought it was the right thing to do. He just doesn’t give a fuck… This is what is so admirable. No, not me, dumbass – the overcoming adversity stuff, the willingness to be different, an outcast, a pariah, all for the sake of one’s own values. The willingness to stare failure in the face and shove your middle finger back at it. The people who don’t give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. The people who just laugh and then do what they believe in anyway. Because they know it’s right. They know it’s more important than they are, more important than their own feelings and their own pride and their own ego. They say, “Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather to everything <i>unimportant </i>in life. They reserve their fucks for what truly matters. Friends. Family. Purpose… And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things that matter, people give a fuck about them in return.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… here’s another sneaky little truth about life. You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others. You just can’t. Because there’s no such thing as a lack of adversity. It doesn’t exist. The old saying goes that no matter where you go, there you are. Well, the same is true for adversity and failure. No matter where you go, there’s a five-hundred-pound load of shit waiting for you. And that’s perfectly fine. The point isn’t to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they don’t have anything more fuck-worthy to dedicate their fucks to.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you – your ex-boyfriend’s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another two-for-one sale on hand sanitizer – chances are you don’t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. And that’s your real problem.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I once heard an artist say that when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some.

Therefore, we give tons of fucks. We give a fuck about everything and everyone –about what people are saying about us, about whether that cute boy/girl called us back or not, about whether our socks match or not, or what color our birthday balloon is… As we get older, with the benefit of experience (and having seen so much time slip by), we begin to notice that most of these sorts of things have little lasting impact on our lives. Those people whose opinions we cared about so much before are no longer present in our lives. Rejections that were painful in the moment have actually worked out for the best. We realize how little attention people pay to the superficial details about us, and we choose not to obsess so much over them… Essentially, we become more selective about the fucks we’re willing to give. This is something called maturity. It’s nice; you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuck-worthy.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Then, as we grow older and enter middle age, something else begins to change. Our energy level drops. Our identity solidifies. We know who we are and we accept ourselves, including some of the parts we aren’t thrilled about… And, in a strange way, this is liberating. We no longer need to give a fuck about everything. Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that we’re never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Aniston’s tits. And that’s okay. Life goes on. We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks for the most truly fuck-worthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing. And, to our astonishment, <i>this is enough</i>.

For this son the king had a particularly good idea: he would make the child’s life perfect. The child would never know a moment of suffering – every need, every desire, would be accounted for at all times.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">The king built high walls around the palace that prevented the prince from knowing the outside world. He spoiled the child, lavishing him with food and gifts, surrounding him with servants who catered to his every whim. And just as planned, the child grew up ignorant of the routine cruelties of human existence.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">All of the prince’s childhood went on like this. But despite endless luxury and opulence, the prince became kind of a pissed-off young man. Soon, every experience felt empty and valueless. The problem was that no matter what his father gave him, it never seemed enough, never <i>meant </i>anything.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">So late one night, the prince snuck out of the palace to see what was beyond its walls. He had a servant drive him through the local village, and what he saw horrified him.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">For the first time in his life, the prince saw human suffering. He saw sick people, old people, homeless people, people in pain, even people dying.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">The prince returned to the palace and found himself in a sort of existential crisis.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not knowing how to process what he’d seen, he got all emo about everything and complained a lot. And, as is typical of young men, the prince ended up blaming his father for the very things his father had tried to do for him. It was the riches, the prince thought, that had made him so miserable, that had made life seem so meaningless. He decided to run away.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">But the prince was more like his father than he knew. He had grand ideas too. He wouldn’t just run away; he would give up his royalty, his family, and all of his possessions and live in the streets, sleeping in the dirt like an animal. There he would starve himself, torture himself, and beg for scraps of food from strangers for the rest of his life.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">The next night, the prince snuck out of the palace again, this time never to return. For years he lived as a bum, a discarded and forgotten remnant of society, the dog shit caked to the bottom of the social totem pole. And as planned, the prince suffered greatly. He suffered through disease, hunger, pain, loneliness, and decay. He confronted the brink of death itself, often limited to eating a single nut each day.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">A few years went by. Then a few more. And then… nothing happened. The prince began to notice that this life of suffering wasn’t all that it was cracked up to be. It wasn’t bringing him the insight he had desired. It wasn’t revealing any deeper mystery of the world or its ultimate purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">In fact, the prince came to know what the rest of us have always kind of known: that suffering totally sucks. And it’s not necessarily that meaningful either. As with being rich, there is no value in suffering when it’s done without purpose. And soon the prince came to the conclusion that his grand idea, like his father’s, was in fact a terrible fucking idea and he should probably go do something else instead.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Totally confused, the prince cleaned himself up and went and found a big tree near a river. He decided that he would sit under that tree and not get up until he came up with another grand idea.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">As the legend goes, the confused prince sat under that tree for forty-nine days. We won’t delve into the biological viability of sitting in the same spot for forty-nine days, but let’s just say that in that time the prince came to a number of profound realizations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">One of those realizations was this: that life itself is a form of suffering. The rich suffer because of their riches. The poor suffer because of their poverty. People without a family suffer because they have no family. People with a family suffer because of their family. People who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures. People who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">This isn’t to say that all suffering is equal. Some suffering is certainly more painful than other suffering. But we all must suffer nonetheless.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Years later, the prince would build his own philosophy and share it with the world, and this would be its first and central tenet: that pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them. The prince would later become known as the Buddha. And in case you haven’t heard of him, he was kind of a big deal.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">There is a premise that underlies a lot of our assumptions and beliefs. The premise is that happiness is algorithmic, that it can be worked for and achieved as if it were getting accepted to law school or building a really complicated Lego set. If I achieve X, then I can be happy. If I look like Y, then I can be happy. If I can be with a person like Z, then I can be happy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">This premise, though, <i>is the problem</i>. Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and, as we’ll see, necessary components to creating consistent happiness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… life itself is a form of suffering.

Pain is what teaches us what to pay attention to when we’re young or careless. It helps show us what’s good for us versus what’s bad for us. It helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations. It teaches us to not fuck around near hot stoves or stick metal objects into electrical sockets.

The keyword here is “solving.” If you’re avoiding your problems or feel like you don’t have any problems, then you’re going to make yourself miserable. If you feel like you have problems that you can’t solve, you will likewise make yourself miserable.

Happiness is therefore a form of action; it’s an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you, not something that you magically discover in a top-ten article on the Huffington Post or from any specific guru or teacher. It doesn’t magically appear when you finally make enough money to add on that extra room to the house. You don’t find it waiting for you in a place, an idea, a job – or even a book, for that matter… Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress – the solutions to today’s problems will lay the foundation for tomorrow’s problems, and so on.

Some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems, even when they in fact could. Victims seek to blame others for their problems or blame outside circumstances.

Whether it’s a substance like alcohol, the moral righteousness that comes from blaming others, or the thrill of some new risky adventure, highs are shallow and unproductive ways to go about one’s life. Much of the self-help world is predicated on peddling highs to people rather than solving legitimate problems. Many self-help gurus teach you new forms of denial and pump you up with exercises that feel good in the short term, while ignoring the underlying issue.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he’s happy.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Highs also generate addiction. The more you rely on them to feel better about your underlying problems, the more you will seek them out. In this sense, almost anything can become addictive, depending on the motivation behind using it. We all have our chosen methods to numb the pain of our problems, and in moderate doses there is nothing wrong with this. But the longer we avoid and the longer we numb, the more painful it will be when we finally do confront our issues.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Emotions Are Overrated</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Emotions evolved for one specific purpose: to help us live and reproduce a little bit better.

Research found that people who <i>thought </i>highly about themselves generally performed better and caused fewer problems. Many researchers and policymakers at the time came to believe that raising a population’s self-esteem could lead to some tangible social benefits: lower crime, better academic records, greater employment, lower budget deficits. As a result, beginning in the next decade, the 1970s, self-esteems practices began to be taught to parents, emphasized by therapists, politicians, and teachers, and instituted into educational policy. Grade inflation, for example, was implemented to make low-achieving kids feel better about their lack of achievement. Participation awards and bogus trophies were invented for any number of mundane and expected activities. Kids were given inane homework assignments, like writing down all the reasons why they thought they were special, or the five things they liked most about themselves. Pastors and ministers told their congregations that they were each uniquely special in God’s eyes, and were destined to excel and not be average. Business and motivational seminars cropped up chanting the same paradoxical mantra: every single one of us can be exceptional and massively successful.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">But it’s a generation later and the data is in: we’re <i>not </i>all exceptional. It turns out that merely feeling good about yourself doesn’t really mean anything unless you have a <i>good reason </i>to feel good about yourself. It turns out that adversity and failure are actually useful and even necessary for developing strong-minded and successful adults. It turns out that teaching people to believe they’re exceptional and to feel good about themselves no matter what doesn’t lead to a population full of Bill Gateses and Martin Luther Kings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The problem with the self-esteem movement is that it measured self-esteem by how positively people felt about themselves. But a true and accurate measurement of one’s self-worth is how people feel about the <i>negative </i>aspects of themselves.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Entitled people feel as though they deserve good things without actually earning them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Entitled people can become so fixated on feeling good about themselves that they manage to delude themselves into believing that they are accomplishing great things even when they’re not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Entitled people exude a delusional degree of self-confidence. This confidence can be alluring to others, at least for a little while. In some instances, the entitled person’s delusional level of confidence can become contagious and help people around the entitled person feel more confident in themselves too… But the problem with</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">entitlement is that it makes people <i>need </i>to feel good about themselves all the time, even at the expense of those around them. And because entitled people always need to feel good about themselves, they end up spending most of their time thinking about themselves. After all, it takes a lot of energy and work to convince yourself that your shit doesn’t stink, especially when you’ve been living in a toilet.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Once people have developed the thought pattern to constantly construe what happens around them as self-aggrandizing, it’s extremely hard to break them out of it.

People who feel entitled view every occurrence in their life as either an affirmation of, or a threat to, their own greatness. If something good happens to them, it’s because of some amazing feat they accomplished. If something bad happens to them, it’s because somebody is jealous and trying to bring them down a notch. Entitlement is impervious. People who are entitled delude themselves into whatever feeds their sense of superiority.

But entitled people, because they are incapable of acknowledging their own problems openly and honestly, are incapable of improving their lives in any lasting and meaningful way.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“My parents are good people.

It takes just as much energy and delusional self-aggrandizement to maintain the belief that one has insurmountable problems as that one has no problems at all… The truth is that there’s no such thing as a personal problem. If you’ve got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. Likely people you know too. That doesn’t minimize the problem or mean that it shouldn’t hurt.

Nonstop… Our lives today are filled with information from the extremes… The vast majority of life is <i>unextraordinary</i>, indeed quite average… The flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal. And because we’re all quite average most of the time, the deluge of exceptional information drives us to feel pretty damn insecure and desperate, because clearly we’re somehow not good enough.

So let’s go over some of the quickly:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Pleasure<span class="p">. Pleasure is great, but it’s a horrible value to prioritize your life around. Ask any drug addict how his pursuit of pleasure turned out. Ask an adulterer who shattered her family and lost her children whether pleasure ultimately made her happy. Ask a man who almost ate himself to death how pleasure helped him solve his problems… Research shows that people who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable, and more depressed. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose… Pleasure is not the cause of happiness; rather, it is the effect.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Material Success<span class="p">. Research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero. So if you’re starving and living on the street in the middle of India, and extra ten thousand dollars a year would affect your happiness a lot. But if you’re sitting pretty in the middle class in a developed country, an extra ten thousand dollars per year won’t affect anything much – meaning that you’re killing yourself working overtime and weekends for basically nothing… When people measure themselves not by their behavior, but by the status symbols they’re able to collect, then not only are they shallow, but they’re probably assholes as well.</span></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Always Being Right<span class="p">.

While there is something to be said for “staying on the sunny side of life,” the truth is, sometimes life sucks, and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it… Denying negative emotions leads to experiencing deeper</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and more prolonged negative emotions and to emotional dysfunction. Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a valid solution to life’s problems… Things go wrong, people upset us, accidents happen. These things make us feel like shit. And that’s fine. Negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health. To deny that negativity is to <i>perpetuate </i>problems rather than solve them… The trick with negative emotions is to 1) express them in a socially acceptable and healthy manner and 2) express them in a way that aligns with your values… When we force ourselves to stay positive at all times, we deny the existence of our life’s problems. And when we deny our problems, we rob ourselves of the chance to solve them and generate happiness. Problems add a sense of meaning and importance to our life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“In the long run, completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake. Raising a child makes us happier than beating a video game. Starting a small business with friends while struggling to make ends meet makes us happier than buying a new computer. These activities are stressful, arduous, and often unpleasant. They also require withstanding problem after problem. Yet they are some of the most meaningful moments and joyous things we’ll ever do. They involve pain, struggle, even anger and despair – yet once they’re accomplished, we look back and get all misty-eyed telling our grandkids about them.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.” –Freud.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“This is why these values – pleasure, material success, always being right, staying positive – are poor ideals for a person’s life.

And it should be that way… But there are also problems that we <i>aren’t </i>at fault for, yet we are still responsible for them… For example, if you woke up one day and there was a newborn baby on your doorstep, it would not be your <i>fault </i>that the baby had been put there, but the baby would now be your <i>responsibility</i>.

Sure, the person who gets dealt great cards has a higher likelihood of winning the hand, but ultimately the winner is determined by – yup, you</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">guessed it – the <i>choices </i>each player makes throughout play… I see life in the same terms. We all get dealt cards. Some of us get better cards than others. And while it’s easy to get hung up on our cards, and feel we got screwed over, the real game lies in the choices we make with those cards, the risks we decide to take, and the consequences we choose to live with. People who consistently make the best choices in the situations they’re given are the ones who eventually come out ahead in poker, just as in life. And it’s not necessarily the people with the best cards.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“There are those who suffer through bad childhoods.

The writer and media commentator Ryan Holiday refers to this as “outrage porn”: rather than report on real stories and real issues, the media find it much easier (and more profitable) to find something mildly offensive, broadcast it to a wider audience, generate outrage, and then broadcast that outrage back across the population in a way that outrages yet another part of the population.

Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The difference between a healthy and unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Wherever there is a healthy and loving relationship, there will be clear boundaries between the two people and their values, and there will be an open avenue of giving and receiving rejection when necessary… By “boundaries” I mean the delineation between two people’s responsibilities for their own problems. People in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partner’s values and problems. People in a toxic relationship with poor or no boundaries will regularly avoid responsibility for their own problems and/or take responsibility for their partner’s problems.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What do poor boundaries look like? Here are some examples:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You can’t go out with your friends without me. You know how jealous I get. You have to stay home with me.”</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“My coworkers are idiots; they always make me late to meeting because I have to tell them how to do their jobs.”</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I can’t believe you made me feel so stupid in front of my own sister. Never disagree with me in front of her again!”</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I’d love to take that job in Milwaukee, but my mother would never forgive me for moving so far away.”</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I can date you, but can you not tell my friend Cindy? She gets really insecure when I have a boyfriend and she doesn’t.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">In each scenario, the person is either taking responsibility for problems/emotions that are not theirs, or demanding that someone else take responsibility for their problems/emotions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">In general, entitled people fall into one of two traps in their relationships. Either they expect other people to take responsibility for <i>their </i>problems: “<i>I wanted a nice relaxing weekend at home. You should have known that and cancelled your plans</i>.” Or they take on too much responsibility for other people’s problems: “<i>She just lost her job again, but it’s probably my fault because I wasn’t as supportive of her as I could have been. I’m going to help her rewrite her resume tomorrow</i>.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Entitled people adopt these strategies in their relationships, as with everything, to help avoid accepting responsibility for their own problems. As a result, their</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">relationships are fragile and fake, products of avoiding inner pain rather than embracing a genuine appreciation and adoration of their partner.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy. The mark of an unhealthy relationship is two people who try to solve each other’s problems in order to feel good about themselves… A healthy relationship is when two people solve their own problems in order to feel good about each other.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The setting of proper boundaries doesn’t mean you can’t help or support your partner or be helped and supported yourself. You both should support each other. But only because you <i>choose </i>to support and be supported. Not because you feel obligated or entitled.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Entitled people who blame others for their own emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they constantly paint themselves as victims, eventually someone will come along and save them, and they will receive the love they’ve always wanted.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Entitled people who take the blame for other people’s emotions and actions do so because they believe that if they “fix” their partner and save him or her, they will receive the love and appreciation they’ve always wanted.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">These are the yin and yang of any toxic relationship: the victim and the saver, the person who starts fires because it makes her feel important and the person who puts out fires because it makes him feel important.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">These two types of people are drawn strongly to one another, and they usually end up together. Their pathologies match one another perfectly. Often they’ve grown up with parents who each exhibit one of these traits well. So their model for a “happy” relationship is one based on entitlement and poor boundaries.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Sadly, they both fail in meeting the other’s actual needs. In fact, their pattern of overblaming and overaccepting blame perpetuates the entitlement and shitty self-worth that have been keeping them from getting their emotional needs met in the first place. The victim creates more and more problems to solve – not because additional real problems exist, but because it gets her the attention and affection she craves. The saver solves and solves – not because she actually cares about the problems, but because she believes she must fix others’ problems in order to deserve attention and affection for herself. In both cases, the intentions are selfish and conditional and therefore self-sabotaging, and genuine love is rarely experienced.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">The victim, if he really loved the saver, would say, “Look, this is my problem; you don’t have to fix it for me. Just support me while I fix it myself.” That would</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">actually <span class="p">be a demonstration of love: taking responsibility for your own problems and not holding your partner responsible for them.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">If the saver really wanted to save the victim, the saver would say, “Look, you’re blaming others for your own problems; deal with this yourself.” And in a sick way, that would <i>actually </i>be a demonstration of love: helping someone solve their own problems.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Instead, victims and savers both use each other to achieve emotional highs. It’s like an addiction they fulfill in one another. Ironically, when presented with emotionally healthy people to date, they usually feel bored or lack “chemistry” with them. They pass on emotionally healthy, secure individuals because the secure partner’s solid boundaries don’t feel “exciting” enough to stimulate the constant highs necessary in the entitled person.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">For victims, the hardest thing to do in the world is to hold themselves accountable for their problems. They’ve spent their whole life believing that others are responsible for their fate. The first step of taking responsibility for themselves is often terrifying.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">For savers, the hardest thing to do in the world is stop taking responsibility for other people’s problems. They’ve spent their whole life feeling valued and loved only when they’re saving somebody else – so letting go of this need is terrifying to them as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">If you make a sacrifice for someone you care about, it needs to be because you want to, not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so. If your partner is going to make a sacrifice for you, it needs to be because he or she genuinely wants to, not because you’ve manipulated the sacrifice through anger or guilt. Acts of love are valid only if they’re performed without conditions or expectations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">It can be difficult for people to recognize the difference between doing something out of obligation and doing it voluntarily. So here’s a litmus test: ask yourself, “If I refused, how would the relationship change?” Similarly, ask, “If my partner refused something I wanted, how would the relationship change?”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">If the answer is that a refusal would cause a blowout of drama and broken china plates, then that’s a bad sign for your relationship. It suggests that your relationship is conditional – based on superficial benefits received from one another, rather than on unconditional acceptance of each other (along with each other’s problems).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">People with strong boundaries are not afraid of a temper tantrum, an argument, or getting hurt. People with weak boundaries are terrified of those things and will constantly mold their own behavior to fit the highs and lows of their relational emotional roller coaster.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">People with strong boundaries understand that it’s unreasonable to expect two people to accommodate each other 100 percent and fulfill every need the other has.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People with strong boundaries understand that they may hurt someone’s feeling sometimes, but ultimately they can’t determine how other people feel. People with</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">strong boundaries understand that a healthy relationship is not about controlling one another’s emotions, but rather about each partner supporting the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">It’s not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about; it’s about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That’s unconditional love, baby.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to Build Trust</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… honesty in my relationship is more important to me than feeling good all the time. The last person I should ever have to censor myself with is the woman I love.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“When our highest priority is to always make ourselves feel good, or to always make our partner feel good, then nobody ends up feeling good. And our relationship falls apart without our even knowing it.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Without conflict, there can be no trust. Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and who is just there for the benefits. No one trusts a yes-man.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">For a relationship to be healthy, both people must be willing and able to both say no and hear no. Without that negation, without that occasional rejection, boundaries break down and one person’s problems and values come to dominate the other’s.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conflict is not only normal, then; it’s <i>absolutely necessary </i>for the maintenance of a healthy relationship. If two people who are close are not able to hash out their differences openly and vocally, then the relationship is based on manipulation and misrepresentation, and it will slowly become toxic.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship, for the simple reason that without trust, the relationship doesn’t actually <i>mean </i>anything. A person could tell you that she loves you, wants to be with you, would give up everything for you, but if you don’t trust her, you get no benefit from those statements. You don’t feel loved until you trust that the love being expressed toward you comes without any special conditions or baggage attached to it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some people become so concerned with holding on to a relationship that they fail to realize it has become a black hole consuming their self-respect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“…building a track record for trust takes time – certainly a lot more time than it takes to break trust.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. Without the first step, there should be no attempt at reconciliation in the first place.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Trust is like a china plate. If you break it once, with some care and attention you can put it back together again. But if you break it again, it splits into even more pieces and it takes far longer to piece together again. If you break it more and more times, eventually it shatters to the point where it’s impossible to restore. There are too many broken pieces, and too much dust.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Freedom Through Commitment</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… more is not always better… We are actually often happier with less. When we’re overloaded with opportunities and options, we suffer from what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice. Basically, the more options we’re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose, because we’re aware of all the other options we’re potentially forfeiting.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… this anxiety, this desire for certainty and perfection and success, will make you unhappy.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… commitment, in its own way, offers a wealth of opportunity and experiences that would otherwise never be available to me, no matter where I went or what I did.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The older you get, the more experienced you get, the less significantly each new experience affects you.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… there is freedom and liberation in commitment. I’ve found <i>increased </i>opportunity and upside in rejecting alternatives and distractions in favor of what I’ve chosen to let truly matter to me… Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. Commitment gives you freedom because it hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. Commitment makes decision-making easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you ever stress about chasing more, more, more again? Commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“…depth is where the gold is buried. And you have to stay committed to something and go deep to dig it up. That’s true in relationships, in a career, in building a great lifestyle – in everything.”</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">CHAPTER 9 – … AND THEN YOU DIE</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Why do you care that I’m dead when you’re still afraid to live?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… I came to the startling realization that if there really is no reason to do anything, then there is also no reason to <i>not </i>do anything; that in the face of the inevitability of death, there is no reason to ever give in to one’s fear or embarrassment or shame, since it’s all just a bunch of nothing anyway; and that by spending the majority of my short life avoiding what was painful and uncomfortable, I had essentially been avoiding being alive at all.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I still had my insecurities and my baggage – as we always do – but now I gave a fuck about something more important than my insecurities and my baggage.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… death is the light by which the shadow of all of life’s meaning is measured. Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Denial of Death<span class="p"> by Ernest Becker – Check this out…</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Denial of Death <span class="p">essentially makes two points:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l5"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Humans are unique in that we’re the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly. Dogs don’t sit around and worry about their career. Cats don’t think about their past mistakes and wonder what would have happened if they’d done something differently. Monkeys don’t argue over future possibilities, just as fish don’t sit around wondering if other fish would like them more if they had longer fins… As humans, we’re blessed with the ability to imagine ourselves in hypothetical situations, to contemplate both the past and the future, to imagine other realities or situations where things might be different. And it’s because of this unique mental ability, Becker says, that we all, at some point, become aware of the inevitability of our own death. Because we’re able to conceptualize alternate versions of reality, we are also the only animal capable of imagining a reality without ourselves in it… This realization causes what Becker calls “death terror,” a deep existential anxiety that underlies <i>everything </i>we think or do.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Becker’s second point starts with the premise that we essentially have two “selves.” The first self is the physical self – the one that eats, sleeps, snores, and poops. The second self is our conceptual self – our identity, or how we see ourselves… Becker’s argument is this: We are all aware on some level that our physical self will eventually die, that this death is inevitable, and that its</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">inevitability – on some unconscious level – scares the shit out of us. Therefore, in order to compensate for our fear of the inevitable loss of our physical self, we try to construct a conceptual self that will live forever. This is why people try so hard to put their names on buildings, on statues, on spines of books. It’s why we feel compelled to spend so much time giving ourselves to others, especially to children, in the hopes that our influence – our conceptual self – will last way beyond our physical self. That we will be remembered and revered and idolized long after our physical self ceases to exist.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Becker called such efforts our “immortality projects,” projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Whether it be through mastering an art form, conquering a new land, gaining great riches, or simply having a large and loving family that will live on for generations, <i>all the meaning in our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die</i>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“But, when our immortality projects fail, when the meaning is lost, when the prospect of our physical self no longer seems possible or likely, death terror – that horrible, depressing anxiety – creeps back into our mind. Trauma can cause this, as can shame and social ridicule. As can, as Becker points out, mental illness.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“If you haven’t figured it out yet, our immortality projects are our values. They are the barometers of meaning and worth in our life. And when our values fail, so do we, psychologically speaking. What Becker is saying, in essence, is that we’re all driven by fear to give way too many fucks about something, because giving a fuck about something is the only thing that distracts us from the reality and inevitability of our own death. And to truly not give a single fuck is to achieve a quasi-spiritual state of embracing the impermanence of one’s own existence. In that state, one is far less likely to get caught up in various forms of entitlement.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Becker later came to a startling realization on his deathbed: that people’s immortality projects were actually the problem, not the solution; that rather than attempting to implement, often through lethal force, their conceptual self across the world, people should question their conceptual self and become more comfortable with the reality of their own death. Becker called this “the bitter antidote,” and struggled with reconciling it himself as he started down his own demise. While death is bad, it is inevitable.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Therefore, we should not avoid this realization, but rather come to terms with it as best we can. Because once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death – the root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions – we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The Stoics of ancient Greece and Rome implored people to keep death in mind at all times, in order to appreciate life more and remain humble in the face of its adversities.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.” – Mark Twain</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life. While most people whittle their days chasing another buck, or a little bit more fame and attention, or a little bit more assurance that they’re right or loved, death confronts all of us with a far more painful and important question: What is your legacy?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">How will the world be different and better when you’re gone? What mark will you have made? What influence will you have caused? They say that a butterfly flapping its wings in Africa can cause a hurricane in Florida; well, what hurricanes will you leave in your wake?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">As Becker pointed out, this is arguably the <i>only </i>truly important question in our life. Yet we avoid thinking about it. One, because it’s hard. Two, because it’s scary.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">Three, because we have no fucking clue what we’re doing.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">And when we avoid this question, we let trivial and hateful values hijack our brains and take control of our desires and ambitions. Without acknowledging the ever-present gaze of death, the superficial will appear important, and the important will appear superficial. Death is the only thing we can know with any certainty. And as such, it must be the compass by which we orient all of our other values and decisions. It is the correct answer to all of the questions we should ask but never do. The only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself; to choose values that stretch beyond serving yourself, that are simple and immediate and controllable and tolerant of the chaotic world around you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“… entitlement strips this away from us. The gravity of entitlement sucks all attention inward, toward ourselves, causing us to feel as though <i>we </i>are at the center of all the problems in the universe, that <i>we </i>are the one suffering all of the injustices, that <i>we </i>are the one who deserves greatness over all others.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The pampering of the modern mind has resulted in a population that feels deserving of something without earning that something, a population that feels they have a right to something without sacrificing for it. People declare themselves experts, entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, mavericks, and coaches without any real-life experience. And they do this not because they actually think they <i>are </i>greater than everybody else; they do it because they feel that they <i>need to be great </i>to be accepted in a world that broadcasts only the extraordinary.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You too are going to die, and that’s because you too were fortunate to have lived.”</p></body></html>
